# BrewBook
One of the most prominent websites for creating homebrew beer recipes is Brewer's Friend (https://www.brewersfriend.com/).
This site is a great resource for for general homebrew information, community interaction, and calculators for formulating
recipes. However, users may only create 5 recipes on the free plan with no ability to delete old, unused recipes. Additionally,
pricing plans are a cost-prohibitive subscription model. To work around this cost, I intend to create a lightweight,
web-based application for creating and sharing an unlimited quantity of beer recipes.
