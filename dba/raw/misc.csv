43,'Ajowan','Herb','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Ajowan seed (also known as carom seed) is native to southern India and is used commonly throughout southern Asia and the Middle East.

It smells and tastes a lot like very strong thyme, though slightly more peppery and with a lightly bitter aftertaste. Dry roasting Ajowan or frying it in oil mellows the flavour and brings out a caraway taste.',-1,-1,0,1,''
44,'Aleppo Chiles','Herb','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Aleppo chiles (sometimes known as halaby peppers) are named after the region in northern Syria where they grow. They have a moderate heat level and a wonderful, complex, fruity flavour.',-1,-1,0,1,''
45,'Allspice','Spice','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Allspice is a ground mixture of baking spices. In reality, allspice is the berry of the pimento bush, grown mostly in Jamaica. It does, however get its name from the fact that it tastes somewhat like a peppery blend of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg.

Allspice loses its flavour very quickly when ground, its recommend to buy whole berries and grinding them yourself just before using.',-1,-1,0,1,''
46,'Ancho Chiles','Herb','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','When a ripe poblano pepper is dried, it becomes an ancho chile. Anchos are quite mild and are used in all kinds of traditional Mexican cooking. Anchos are deep red-brown and have a wonderful, sweet raisiny flavour that provide lots of personality to food without a lot of heat. These are the most commonly used chile in Mexico.',-1,-1,0,1,''

51,'Caraway Seeds','Spice','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Caraway seeds have a very distinctive taste and aroma that makes many people think immediately of bread.

52,'Cardamom, Black','Spice','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','In a way, it''s not fair that this spice has to share its name with the sweet and elegant green cardamom. Black cardamom is a totally different spice, and is not nearly as glamourous. Its pods are large and rough, it has an earthy, smoky flavour and it can never be used as a substitute for the more expensive and popular green variety. It does have its place, though. Black cardamom is used to give depth to Indian cooking, and it can be an important ingredient in many curry masalas.',-1,-1,0,1,''

59,'Citric Acid','Flavor','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Citric acid is a mild natural acid found in citrus fruits; it is responsible for the sourness of lemons and limes. In its pure form, citric acid looks pretty much exactly like granulated sugar and acts as a natural preservative and a tart flavouring. It is sometimes used in the making of wine and ice cream, and is widely used in softdrinks, sour candies and other recipes to mimic the flavour of fresh lemon.',-1,-1,0,1,''
60,'Cloves','Spice','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Cloves are the most pungent and oily of all spices. They are the unopened buds of the clove tree and have a hot, sharp, bitter flavour. They will easily overpower other flavours, so they must be used very carefully.',-1,-1,0,1,''

66,'Galangal','Herb','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Galangal is a rhizome that looks a lot like ginger. Its flavour is similar to ginger, but not nearly as spicy and with hints of lemon and cardamom.',-1,-1,0,1,''

73,'Juniper Berries','Flavor','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','The small, blue-black berries of the juniper bush are best known in the culinary world for flavouring gin, and their smell and flavour brings this to mind immediately. Thier piney taste cuts nicely through strong, rich flavours for a pleasant contrast. The berries are always sold whole, but they are soft and easy to crush in a mortar or with the flat of a knife.',-1,-1,0,1,''

78,'Mace','Spice','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Mace is possibly the most interesting and unique of all spices. It’s a little-known fact that mace is from the same seed pod that gives us nutmeg. While nutmeg is the inner seed of the pod, mace is the lacy reddish net that surrounds the outside of the shell. During harvest, the mace is removed whole and dried, at which point it is known as a blade.

Mace is very similar to nutmeg in flavour and scent, though a little more delicate and sweet. It is also more expensive, since there is so much less of it in each pod.',-1,-1,0,1,''
79,'Marash Chiles','Herb','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Crushed Marash chiles are very similar to our Aleppo chiles from Syria, but have an even fruitier taste and are ever so slightly less acidic.',-1,-1,0,1,''
80,'Mulato Chiles','Herb','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Mulato chiles are very similar to ancho chiles: both are dried poblanos, but it is the darker, riper poblanos that become mulatos. This extra ripeness makes mulato chiles darker and sweeter than anchos, and gives them an earthier flavour.',-1,-1,0,1,''
81,'Nutmeg','Spice','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Nutmeg is the hard inner seed found inside the fruit of a nutmeg tree, and it has one of the most unique and recognizable flavours of all spices.

82,'Pasilla Chiles','Herb','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','When the long, twisted chilaca chile is dried it is called a pasilla chile, or sometimes a “pasilla negro.” Pasilla means “little raisin” and it gets this name from its flavour – berry and grape with a hint of licorice.

84,'Saffron','Spice','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Saffron is the most expensive spice on Earth. This is because of the labour involved in growing and harvesting the spice. Saffron is the red-yellow stigma of the crocus flower and must be hand-picked during short annual flowering seasons. Each flower produces only three stigmas, so it takes approximately 150 flowers to yield just one gram of dry saffron threads. ',-1,-1,0,1,''

88,'Peppercorns, Szechuan','Spice','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Szechuan pepper is the outer husk of the fruit of the Chinese prickly ash tree. The berries are dried and split open, and the bitter seeds inside are discarded. The flavour of Szechuan pepper is very fragrant, lemony and pungent and it has a biting astringency on the tongue',-1,-1,0,1,''
89,'Tien Tsin Chiles','Herb','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Tien Tsin chiles are very hot Chinese chiles that are particularly suited to Hunan and Szechuan cuisines.',-1,-1,0,1,''
90,'Tonka Beans','Herb','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','Tonka beans are very unusual little beans that grow primarily in the northern part of South America. They share a lot of similarities with vanilla beans, to the point where they are sometimes used as a vanilla substitute. They are black and wrinkly, about an inch long, and have a sweet flavour that is like a combination of vanilla, cloves and cinnamon with a nuttiness reminiscent of almonds. Really delicious and unusual.',-1,-1,0,1,''
91,'Peppercorns, White','Spice','Boil',0.0,0.0,'true','','White peppercorns are picked from the vine when they are almost ripe - much later than black or green peppercorns. When picked, they are a yellowish-pink colour. The peppercorns are treated with water to remove the skin, and then sun-dried.
